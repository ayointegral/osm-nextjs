# Map Tile Caching & Optimization Documentation

## Overview

The map implementation uses a multi-layered approach to caching and optimization to ensure smooth tile loading and transitions. This document outlines the different caching mechanisms and their purposes.

## Caching Layers

### 1. Browser-Level Caching
- **Natural Browser Cache**: Tiles are cached by the browser's HTTP cache
- **Benefits**: Zero implementation overhead, handles If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers
- **Location**: Browser's cache storage

### 2. In-Memory Tile Tracking
Located in `HighZoomTileLayer.tsx`:
- **loadingQueue**: Tracks tiles currently being loaded
- **loadedTiles**: Maintains record of successfully loaded tiles
- **parentTiles**: Caches parent tiles for high zoom levels
- **Purpose**: Prevents duplicate requests and enables smooth zoom transitions

### 3. Settings Persistence
Located in `Map.tsx`:
- **Mechanism**: Debounced saves to backend
- **Data Stored**: 
  - Default provider
  - Default zoom level
  - Default center coordinates
- **Purpose**: Maintains user preferences across sessions

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Progressive Loading
- **Implementation**: HighZoomTileLayer component
- **Features**:
  - Quality-based scaling
  - Hardware-accelerated transforms
  - Smooth transitions between zoom levels

### 2. Tile Preloading
Two implementations:
1. **Map Component** (`Map.tsx`):
   - Preloads adjacent tiles based on viewport
   - Handles basic tile loading events

2. **High Zoom Layer** (`HighZoomTileLayer.tsx`):
   - Manages high-zoom specific preloading
   - Handles parent tile caching for zoom transitions

### 3. Error Handling
- Transparent fallback tiles
- Automatic retries on failure
- Progressive enhancement for high zoom levels

## Configuration

### Tile Provider Settings
Located in `tile-utils.ts`:
```typescript
interface TileProvider {
  name: string;
  url: string;
  attribution: string;
  maxZoom: number;
  minZoom: number;
  maxNativeZoom: number;
  highZoomConfig?: {
    quality: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    progressiveLoading: boolean;
    scaleMethod: 'nearest' | 'bilinear' | 'pixelated' | 'auto';
  };
}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Tile caches are cleared on unmount
   - Parent tiles are preserved for zoom transitions
   - Loading queue prevents duplicate requests

2. **Rendering Optimization**:
   - Hardware acceleration for transforms
   - Efficient text scaling at high zoom levels
   - Progressive loading with quality controls

3. **Network Optimization**:
   - Intelligent preloading of adjacent tiles
   - Caching of parent tiles for zoom transitions
   - Debounced settings persistence

## Future Improvements

1. **Potential Optimizations**:
   - Consolidate tile tracking mechanisms
   - Optimize settings persistence frequency
   - Streamline high-zoom handling

2. **Monitoring Considerations**:
   - Add tile loading performance metrics
   - Track cache hit/miss rates
   - Monitor memory usage patterns
